								Have you had a dream that turned into Reality? or a plan that just happened? Well, this is why this web page is black and white. It is because all the places, the pictures, the videos  and the experiences you will see in this webpage was just a dream and was just a plan that is the reason why it is black and white. Until, i was lucky and blessed enough to have the opportunity to make all these dreams and plans make it to reality. The other reason that this webpage is mostly black is because my friends call me "Egoy" which means black =)

                <p>Like i said on My Home Page. I would like to thank you for stopping by and checking out my Page. The purpose for this web page is for people to get to know me and make new connection and network around the world. It doesn't hurt to make new friends from different parts of the world, right?</p>

                <p>My name is Rodolfo Poserio Jr, some people call me Rudy or Rodolfo but my friends and family calls me JayR. so it's up to you which name you want to use to call me. I was born and raised in Philippines. Came to the US after graduating in highschool. I have a big family. To be specific i have 5 sisters, 2 brothers, 2 nephews and 1 niece. I love my family and they mean the world to me. We try to get the family together as much as we can even if we all live in different places and have crazy busy schedules. </p>

                <p> As a young professional, I have been working in retail environment and customer service for about 16 years now. I started as a part time  associate and just worked my way up to be a store manager. I am currently in webdev boot camp to be an aspiring web developer. The reason why i am taking this bootcamp is because i would like to create and make something that can make a difference. I also like to try something to new, and for me i think this is the best time to do it.
                </p>

                <p>For past time or whenever i have the money, I love to travel. There is nothing more than i would like to do than to see the world, experience new things and learn different cultures. I have visited 4 continents, 12 countries, 16 states and looking forward to add more on my list. So, if you need a travel buddy or just need some travel tips to all the places ive been to, feel free to connect with me.    </p>
